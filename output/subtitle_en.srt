0:00:09,200 --> 0:00:15,520
Hey Wisecrack, Jared again. This is me at the midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises back in 2012.

3
0:00:15,720 --> 0:00:23,440
Needless to say, I was out of my mind excited. But despite my Dark Knight infatuation, I couldn't help but be disappointed.

4
0:00:24,180 --> 0:00:27,340
The Dark Knight Rises is not necessarily a bad movie.

5
0:00:27,340 --> 0:00:28,719
That comes later.

6
0:00:28,719 --> 0:00:31,700
It just pales in comparison to its predecessor.

7
0:00:31,700 --> 0:00:38,380
But as with anything graced with the name Nolan, and by that I mean this one, this film has a lot of intellectual ambition.

8
0:00:38,740 --> 0:00:43,680
Unfortunately, not all of it pans out. So let's dive in to see what works and what doesn't.

9
0:00:44,580 --> 0:00:48,540
Welcome to special Wisecrack Edition on The Dark Knight Rises. What went wrong?

10
0:00:48,540 --> 0:00:54,900
And of course, spoilers ahead. A lot of my disappointment with The Dark Knight Rises stems from its smart setup, but

11
0:00:55,240 --> 0:00:56,439
questionable execution.

12
0:00:56,439 --> 0:01:02,880
So let's start with one of its smartest elements, the very unexpected influence of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities.

13
0:01:02,880 --> 0:01:07,440
The Dark Knight Rises replicates most of the book's major themes, including social inequality,

14
0:01:07,760 --> 0:01:13,480
resurrection, and doubling. The most obvious thematic parallel with A Tale of Two Cities is social inequality.

15
0:01:13,480 --> 0:01:16,000
The rich don't even go broke the same as the rest of us, huh?

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:21,360
The book's setting, the French Revolution, depicts a decadent aristocracy and their abuse of the poor.

17
0:01:21,660 --> 0:01:26,419
Likewise, the film portrays a similar class conflict through Bane's false revolution.

18
0:01:26,419 --> 0:01:33,820
Now we come here not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people.

19
0:01:33,820 --> 0:01:37,580
The third book in the novel is called Track of a Storm, and Catwoman says,

20
0:01:37,580 --> 0:01:39,580
There's a storm coming, Mr. Bane.

21
0:01:39,980 --> 0:01:42,940
Then there's the theme of resurrection. In A Tale of Two Cities,

22
0:01:43,180 --> 0:01:45,180
Dickens frequently uses the phrase,

23
0:01:45,180 --> 0:01:49,800
recalled to life, to signify that his characters are metaphorically brought back from the dead.

24
0:01:49,800 --> 0:01:56,820
One of the main characters is metaphorically brought back to life when he sees his daughter after 18 years in the Bastille, or in his words,

25
0:01:56,820 --> 0:01:58,019
buried alive.

26
0:01:58,019 --> 0:02:02,900
Similarly, Bruce Wayne is metaphorically recalled to life when Catwoman steals his fingerprints,

27
0:02:02,900 --> 0:02:07,139
forcing him to leave Wayne Manor after eight years of self-imposed isolation.

28
0:02:07,139 --> 0:02:11,860
I care for no man on Earth, and no man cares for me.

29
0:02:11,940 --> 0:02:16,820
Another character named Carton is resurrected when he sacrifices himself for another character,

30
0:02:16,820 --> 0:02:18,419
Take my coat. Hurry!

31
0:02:18,419 --> 0:02:20,419
thus giving meaning to his aimless life.

32
0:02:21,539 --> 0:02:23,380
This arc is reflected in Catwoman,

33
0:02:23,380 --> 0:02:25,380
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

34
0:02:25,380 --> 0:02:26,580
There's more to you than that.

35
0:02:26,580 --> 0:02:29,380
who overcomes her selfishness and saves Batman.

36
0:02:29,380 --> 0:02:36,259
This can also be likened to Officer Foley, who sacrifices his life to save Gotham after being complacent with the takeover.

37
0:02:36,259 --> 0:02:39,940
These guys run the city. We've all got to keep our heads down until they can fix this.

38
0:02:39,940 --> 0:02:42,339
Carton even quotes the story of Lazarus.

39
0:02:42,339 --> 0:02:45,860
Lazarus, of course, being the guy Christ resurrected in the Bible.

40
0:02:45,860 --> 0:02:51,539
Bruce is metaphorically resurrected when he rebuilds his strength and climbs out of the Lazarus Pit.

41
0:02:51,539 --> 0:02:56,660
Darnay, the guy Carton saved, is given a second chance at life when he is spared from execution.

42
0:02:56,660 --> 0:03:01,940
And Bruce is again metaphorically resurrected when we find out at the end that he is in fact not dead,

43
0:03:01,940 --> 0:03:04,979
and is given a second chance to live a more rewarding life.

44
0:03:04,979 --> 0:03:09,139
Even the title The Dark Knight Rises invokes a phoenix rising from the ashes.

45
0:03:09,139 --> 0:03:12,259
The poster for the film swaps out a phoenix for the bat symbol,

46
0:03:12,259 --> 0:03:16,020
and chapter 23 of A Tale of Two Cities is called Fire Rises.

47
0:03:16,020 --> 0:03:17,380
Have we started the fire?

48
0:03:17,380 --> 0:03:19,460
Yes, the fire rises.

49
0:03:19,460 --> 0:03:22,979
Oh yeah, and both texts feature a capitalist named Stryver.

50
0:03:22,979 --> 0:03:24,899
You're no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

51
0:03:24,899 --> 0:03:29,779
At Batman's funeral, Gordon even reads this line about Carton's sacrifice and moral resurrection

52
0:03:29,779 --> 0:03:31,860
straight from the end of A Tale of Two Cities.

53
0:03:31,860 --> 0:03:34,259
It is a far, far better thing that I do.

54
0:03:34,259 --> 0:03:37,220
It is a far, far better thing that I do.

55
0:03:37,220 --> 0:03:38,500
Than I have ever done.

56
0:03:38,500 --> 0:03:40,020
Than I have ever done.

57
0:03:40,020 --> 0:03:41,779
Finally, there's the theme of doubling.

58
0:03:41,779 --> 0:03:43,460
You've probably heard the opening lines,

59
0:03:43,460 --> 0:03:46,020
it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

60
0:03:46,020 --> 0:03:50,419
This contrasting between pairs, between best of times and worst of times,

61
0:03:50,419 --> 0:03:54,820
between age of wisdom and foolishness, between epic of belief and incredulity,

62
0:03:54,820 --> 0:03:56,419
happens throughout the whole book.

63
0:03:56,419 --> 0:03:59,619
There are two Manets, two cities, London and Paris,

64
0:03:59,619 --> 0:04:03,779
Darnay has two trials, and Darnay and Carton look the exact same.

65
0:04:03,779 --> 0:04:07,860
In The Dark Knight Rises, there's two cities, Gotham and Bane's Underground,

66
0:04:07,860 --> 0:04:12,020
Batman and Bane, two League of Shadows alums who deal with unbearable pain,

67
0:04:17,299 --> 0:04:20,100
one born in privilege, another born in hell.

68
0:04:20,100 --> 0:04:23,220
Blake and Batman are both orphans with anger issues,

69
0:04:27,700 --> 0:04:30,980
and a constant reminder of the division between body and soul.

70
0:04:30,980 --> 0:04:35,459
So, what we've got here is probably the most graceful thematic adaptation

71
0:04:35,459 --> 0:04:38,179
from a classic to a comic book movie in existence.

72
0:04:38,179 --> 0:04:42,339
But the problem is that on top of developing new themes borrowed from A Tale of Two Cities,

73
0:04:42,339 --> 0:04:45,540
the film also has to juggle the themes established in The Dark Knight.

74
0:04:45,540 --> 0:04:47,940
And here's where the film starts to stumble.

75
0:04:47,940 --> 0:04:51,700
One of the essential themes of The Dark Knight is truth versus lies.

76
0:04:51,700 --> 0:04:53,700
The Dark Knight ends with a noble lie,

77
0:04:55,700 --> 0:04:58,500
Batman takes responsibility for the crime he committed,

78
0:04:59,459 --> 0:05:02,260
Batman takes responsibility for Harvey Dent's murders,

79
0:05:02,260 --> 0:05:05,859
thus denying the fall of Gotham's savior and upholding the image of him

80
0:05:05,859 --> 0:05:08,260
as an ideal symbol of justice and hope.

81
0:05:14,100 --> 0:05:17,059
Herein lies one of the most squandered opportunities of the film.

82
0:05:18,660 --> 0:05:21,059
Many incredible works end with a noble lie.

83
0:05:21,059 --> 0:05:23,619
In Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, for example,

84
0:05:23,619 --> 0:05:28,579
Marlowe lies to Kurtz's widow by telling her that Kurtz's last words were her name,

85
0:05:28,579 --> 0:05:32,500
saving her from the truth that he died a deranged psychopath.

86
0:05:32,500 --> 0:05:34,179
Or in Alan Moore's Watchmen,

87
0:05:34,179 --> 0:05:39,619
the team agrees to preserve Ozymandias' lie that millions were killed by an extraterrestrial force

88
0:05:39,619 --> 0:05:43,140
in order to maintain peace between the US and the USSR.

89
0:05:43,140 --> 0:05:47,540
However, both Heart of Darkness and Watchmen end without the truth ever coming out.

90
0:05:47,540 --> 0:05:51,779
We're left to ponder what's more important, the truth or the saving lie?

91
0:05:51,779 --> 0:05:54,339
The Dark Knight leaves us with this same ambiguity,

92
0:05:54,339 --> 0:05:57,540
but The Dark Knight Rises picks up where these stories left off.

93
0:05:57,540 --> 0:05:58,899
Thematically, of course.

94
0:05:58,899 --> 0:06:03,940
So finally, we get to see what happens when a noble lie is exposed to the vulgar truth.

95
0:06:03,940 --> 0:06:08,339
Maybe it's time we all stop trying to outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

96
0:06:08,339 --> 0:06:10,100
Does the film live up to the challenge?

97
0:06:10,100 --> 0:06:12,339
Unfortunately, not really.

98
0:06:12,339 --> 0:06:14,019
At the beginning of The Dark Knight Rises,

99
0:06:14,019 --> 0:06:17,540
we see that the noble lie has manifested itself in the Dent Act,

100
0:06:17,540 --> 0:06:22,019
a piece of legislation that allows cops increased power to prosecute organized crime.

101
0:06:30,980 --> 0:06:32,739
There are two ways this can be read.

102
0:06:32,739 --> 0:06:35,540
One, we can read it as a metaphor for the Patriot Act,

103
0:06:35,540 --> 0:06:40,100
a law criticized for giving the government a dangerous amount of power to fight terrorism.

104
0:06:40,100 --> 0:06:44,980
Considering many interpret the Joker's radicalism as a reflection of Al-Qaeda extremism,

105
0:06:44,980 --> 0:06:46,100
this makes sense.

106
0:06:46,100 --> 0:06:50,339
Or two, Harvey Dent can be read as a Christ figure without resurrection,

107
0:06:50,339 --> 0:06:52,579
a kind of atheistic interpretation.

108
0:06:52,579 --> 0:06:57,220
Imagine if Christ never came back to life, but people fabricated the lie that he did

109
0:06:57,220 --> 0:07:02,579
in order to maintain his divine status and create a religious institution founded on a lie.

110
0:07:02,579 --> 0:07:06,260
Based on this reading, Christ, like Dent, would be a false idol,

111
0:07:06,260 --> 0:07:09,700
but one that must be upheld in order to maintain peace and hope.

112
0:07:16,420 --> 0:07:18,420
Fallen idol.

113
0:07:18,420 --> 0:07:21,619
Gothamites even celebrate his legacy with Harvey Dent Day,

114
0:07:21,619 --> 0:07:24,899
which I'm sure will be moved to late December to stimulate the economy.

115
0:07:24,899 --> 0:07:28,179
Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday,

116
0:07:28,179 --> 0:07:30,899
but we're here tonight because it's one of the most important.

117
0:07:30,899 --> 0:07:34,420
Considered in this light, the Dent Act can be likened to the way that religion has been

118
0:07:34,420 --> 0:07:38,019
used to justify overreaching acts of power like the Inquisition.

119
0:07:38,019 --> 0:07:42,420
As juicy as this sounds, neither of these extended metaphors actually pan out.

120
0:07:42,420 --> 0:07:45,059
Because contrary to what the film wants us to assume,

121
0:07:45,059 --> 0:07:48,660
there's no evidence that the product of the lie is corrupt.

122
0:07:48,660 --> 0:07:51,380
In fact, the Dent Act seems to work wonders.

123
0:07:51,380 --> 0:07:53,380
When you and Dent cleaned up the streets, you cleaned them good.

124
0:07:54,019 --> 0:07:58,019
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down overdue library books.

125
0:07:58,019 --> 0:08:03,459
Once Bane reveals the truth that Harvey Dent is a false idol and the Dent Act is built off this lie,

126
0:08:03,459 --> 0:08:05,220
it leads to social unrest.

127
0:08:05,220 --> 0:08:09,140
So is the film trying to say that bad stuff happens when the truth is revealed?

128
0:08:09,140 --> 0:08:13,940
It seems so, considering when Alfred reveals the truth about Rachel choosing Dent over Bruce,

129
0:08:19,459 --> 0:08:23,459
it just drives them further apart and encourages Bruce to go on his suicide mission.

130
0:08:23,459 --> 0:08:27,540
But the problem comes when the film doubles back to the conclusion of The End of the Dark Knight,

131
0:08:27,540 --> 0:08:32,179
because everything is only fixed when the truth is buried and another lie is established.

132
0:08:32,260 --> 0:08:34,340
He said it to fly out over the water but eject?

133
0:08:34,340 --> 0:08:35,460
No autopilot.

134
0:08:35,460 --> 0:08:40,020
At the end, Wayne lies about the Bat's autopilot being broken so that he can fake his death.

135
0:08:40,020 --> 0:08:41,619
Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.

136
0:08:41,619 --> 0:08:42,419
Software patch.

137
0:08:42,419 --> 0:08:43,219
Six months ago.

138
0:08:43,219 --> 0:08:44,419
Check the ID on the patch.

139
0:08:44,419 --> 0:08:45,059
Bruce Wayne.

140
0:08:45,059 --> 0:08:48,020
Thus, the narrative of Batman sacrificing himself for Gotham

141
0:08:48,020 --> 0:08:51,140
creates another image of justice for Gotham to revere.

142
0:08:51,140 --> 0:08:55,140
The final lines from A Tale of Two Cities that Gordon quotes during Bruce's funeral

143
0:08:55,140 --> 0:08:57,539
reflect Carton's Christ-like sacrifice,

144
0:08:57,539 --> 0:09:01,299
thereby suggesting that Batman's sacrifice is also Christ-like.

145
0:09:01,299 --> 0:09:03,539
However, as the final shots of the movie prove,

146
0:09:03,539 --> 0:09:06,340
Batman did not sacrifice himself for Gotham.

147
0:09:06,340 --> 0:09:09,940
But perhaps it's necessary to believe the lie that he did,

148
0:09:09,940 --> 0:09:14,099
just as it was necessary to believe the lie that Harvey Dent was noble to the end.

149
0:09:14,099 --> 0:09:18,659
After spending nearly three fucking hours to find out how this theme of truth will develop,

150
0:09:18,659 --> 0:09:22,340
we end up exactly at the same spot as The End of the Dark Knight,

151
0:09:22,340 --> 0:09:26,020
establishing the necessity of a lie to uphold faith in justice.

152
0:09:27,460 --> 0:09:30,099
If the theme of the noble lie were to truly develop,

153
0:09:30,099 --> 0:09:35,059
we might be presented with a scenario in which the toxic lies lead to so much corruption

154
0:09:35,059 --> 0:09:39,780
that revealing the lie would be more beneficial than letting it fester and destroy Gotham.

155
0:09:39,780 --> 0:09:43,619
The film attempts to do this by suggesting that the corruption of the Dent Act

156
0:09:43,619 --> 0:09:46,979
leads to Bane's social revolution, as evidenced by Gordon's quote.

157
0:09:46,979 --> 0:09:49,140
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.

158
0:09:49,140 --> 0:09:50,179
We won.

159
0:09:50,179 --> 0:09:52,099
A stone lie.

160
0:09:52,099 --> 0:09:53,940
Nothing is evil.

161
0:09:53,940 --> 0:09:57,059
Rising from where we tried to bury it.

162
0:09:57,059 --> 0:10:00,340
Bane is supposed to be the outcome of this toxic lie.

163
0:10:00,340 --> 0:10:04,260
Given Gordon's words, it seems like Bane was meant to function like the Joker did,

164
0:10:04,260 --> 0:10:05,859
as a product of escalation.

165
0:10:05,859 --> 0:10:10,099
In The Dark Knight, we get super clear exposition that shows the state of society

166
0:10:10,099 --> 0:10:11,780
that leads to the rise of the Joker.

167
0:10:18,419 --> 0:10:22,419
Batman has put so many drug dealers out of business and inspired so much fear,

168
0:10:28,020 --> 0:10:30,340
that the mob has been pushed to desperation,

169
0:10:30,340 --> 0:10:35,380
leading to the rise of a radically antithetical form of Batman's brand of justice, the Joker.

170
0:10:37,539 --> 0:10:41,460
It seems Gordon was trying to suggest that when abusive power based on a lie

171
0:10:41,460 --> 0:10:46,500
leads to unsavory political and economic tensions, a violent reaction is bound to happen.

172
0:10:46,500 --> 0:10:50,260
But once again, we have no evidence of this corruption at the hands of the Dent Act,

173
0:10:50,260 --> 0:10:52,099
or the lie that justifies it.

174
0:10:52,099 --> 0:10:56,500
In one scene, Catwoman tricks a man threatening her life by making him use the cell phone of

175
0:10:56,500 --> 0:11:00,419
a missing congressman, and seconds later, the police bombard in.

176
0:11:00,419 --> 0:11:04,580
This can be read as an indication that the Dent Act allows for the monitoring of everyone's

177
0:11:04,580 --> 0:11:07,700
cell phones, which would make sense given the Patriot Act parallel.

178
0:11:07,700 --> 0:11:10,419
But the problem is, this saves Catwoman's life.

179
0:11:10,419 --> 0:11:13,059
Without this kind of power, Catwoman would be dead.

180
0:11:13,059 --> 0:11:16,500
Why not show us the negative consequences of invasive surveillance?

181
0:11:16,500 --> 0:11:20,500
The film throws away this opportunity to comment on how those in power

182
0:11:20,500 --> 0:11:23,859
can use a lie to justify excessive authority.

183
0:11:23,859 --> 0:11:26,340
This brings us to the second theme of the movie.

184
0:11:26,419 --> 0:11:26,919
Pain.

185
0:11:30,260 --> 0:11:33,700
This theme, like Truth, spends nearly three hours developing,

186
0:11:33,700 --> 0:11:35,619
just to bring us back to where we started.

187
0:11:35,619 --> 0:11:39,780
At the beginning, Bruce, stricken with physical pain and the pain of losing Rachel,

188
0:11:39,780 --> 0:11:40,900
doesn't leave his mansion.

189
0:11:40,900 --> 0:11:44,820
He overcomes his pain when he heals his back and escapes the Lazarus Pit.

190
0:11:44,820 --> 0:11:49,059
But he ultimately gives in to pain again, when he decides to stop being Batman,

191
0:11:49,059 --> 0:11:52,900
fucks off to Italy, and starts living that bored billionaire lifestyle.

192
0:11:52,979 --> 0:11:56,900
Now, I'm going to bring another literary work in here to possibly defend

193
0:11:56,900 --> 0:11:58,979
the cyclical nature of these two themes.

194
0:11:58,979 --> 0:12:00,739
George Orwell's Animal Farm.

195
0:12:00,739 --> 0:12:03,859
See, in Animal Farm, Orwell does a very clever thing.

196
0:12:03,859 --> 0:12:06,580
The term revolution is given a double meaning.

197
0:12:06,580 --> 0:12:11,059
On the one hand, it denotes the revolution when the animals overthrow their human oppressors.

198
0:12:11,059 --> 0:12:14,900
But the original definition of revolution is also given significance

199
0:12:14,900 --> 0:12:17,380
because the novel comes full circle.

200
0:12:17,380 --> 0:12:18,659
It revolves.

201
0:12:18,659 --> 0:12:22,099
At the end, the pigs are just like the humans they overthrew.

202
0:12:22,099 --> 0:12:23,619
Greedy capitalists.

203
0:12:23,619 --> 0:12:27,140
So could the Nolans be playing with this double meaning of the word revolution

204
0:12:27,140 --> 0:12:32,260
by having the themes of pain and truth come full circle in a film about social revolution?

205
0:12:32,260 --> 0:12:32,900
Maybe.

206
0:12:32,900 --> 0:12:35,140
Or maybe I'm just giving them too much credit.

207
0:12:35,140 --> 0:12:36,179
You guys decide.

208
0:12:36,179 --> 0:12:39,059
The third major theme in the film is social inequality.

209
0:12:39,059 --> 0:12:43,299
But whereas A Tale of Two Cities aptly displays the decadence and corruption

210
0:12:43,299 --> 0:12:45,299
of the elite that leads to social unrest,

211
0:12:45,299 --> 0:12:50,020
The Dark Knight Rises gives us a vague, muddy, and almost nonsensical display

212
0:12:50,020 --> 0:12:54,099
of the social tensions that lead to Bane's false revolution against the rich.

213
0:12:58,419 --> 0:13:02,179
According to Bane, Blackgate Prison is a symbol of the Dent Act's oppression.

214
0:13:06,099 --> 0:13:07,539
Blackgate is overcrowded,

215
0:13:07,539 --> 0:13:09,700
men and women sometimes share cell blocks,

216
0:13:09,700 --> 0:13:12,260
and criminals under the Dent Act don't get parole.

217
0:13:12,260 --> 0:13:13,780
Sure, it's harsh and unjust,

218
0:13:13,780 --> 0:13:18,099
but it's hardly the gratuitous cruelty we see in, say, A Tale of Two Cities.

219
0:13:20,979 --> 0:13:24,820
These unfortunate realities seem to pale in comparison to the

220
0:13:24,820 --> 0:13:26,820
overwhelming success of the Dent Act.

221
0:13:36,340 --> 0:13:39,299
Especially considering that the law's inability to fight crime

222
0:13:39,299 --> 0:13:41,619
is a central conflict of the first two films.

223
0:13:45,619 --> 0:13:48,340
And even if Blackgate was wrongfully imprisoning people,

224
0:13:48,340 --> 0:13:50,820
how does that translate to overthrowing the rich?

225
0:13:50,820 --> 0:13:54,580
Blackgate is a clear stand-in for the Bastille during the French Revolution.

226
0:13:54,580 --> 0:13:56,419
And drawing that analogy out farther,

227
0:13:56,419 --> 0:13:59,940
the Dent Act is meant to be the French Le Trait de Cachet,

228
0:13:59,940 --> 0:14:03,140
a kind of warrant issued by the King of France that detained people

229
0:14:03,140 --> 0:14:07,539
without being burdened by annoying shit like proof or reasonable suspicion.

230
0:14:07,539 --> 0:14:10,979
The Bastille became a symbol for the excesses of the King's authority.

231
0:14:10,979 --> 0:14:13,700
People could be thrown in jail for practicing the wrong religion,

232
0:14:13,700 --> 0:14:17,940
or criticizing the government, or pissing off the wrong nobleman at the wrong time.

233
0:14:17,940 --> 0:14:20,500
And when popular rage finally reached a breaking point,

234
0:14:20,500 --> 0:14:22,580
the Bastille was an obvious target.

235
0:14:22,580 --> 0:14:24,820
Problem is, this analogy doesn't really fit,

236
0:14:24,820 --> 0:14:26,979
because Blackgate does none of these things.

237
0:14:26,979 --> 0:14:29,299
King Louis didn't go around eradicating the mob

238
0:14:29,299 --> 0:14:31,380
and making France safe with his authority.

239
0:14:31,380 --> 0:14:34,419
And if the Gotham police are abusing their authority, like Louis,

240
0:14:34,419 --> 0:14:35,619
we're not shown it.

241
0:14:35,619 --> 0:14:38,739
I also suppose that this would have complicated the final showdown scene

242
0:14:38,739 --> 0:14:40,659
in which the cops are the good guys.

243
0:14:40,659 --> 0:14:45,619
So if the Dent Act alone doesn't justify people overthrowing Gotham's social structures,

244
0:14:45,619 --> 0:14:46,979
maybe it's something else?

245
0:14:46,979 --> 0:14:50,020
The Kid in the Orphanage suggests that the economic situation

246
0:14:50,020 --> 0:14:53,380
is making orphans go into the sewers and join Bane's army.

247
0:14:53,380 --> 0:14:54,820
There's work down there.

248
0:14:54,820 --> 0:14:55,320
Work?

249
0:14:56,580 --> 0:14:58,099
What kind of work are you going to find in the sewers?

250
0:14:59,460 --> 0:15:01,460
More than you can find up here, I guess.

251
0:15:01,460 --> 0:15:05,219
But we're given zero indication on how the Dent Act or Blackgate

252
0:15:05,219 --> 0:15:07,140
are disenfranchising the poor.

253
0:15:07,140 --> 0:15:09,780
The only evidence we see of elite corruption

254
0:15:09,780 --> 0:15:13,380
is when Daggett tries to steal Wayne Enterprises from Bruce Wayne.

255
0:15:13,380 --> 0:15:15,780
But that's the rich screwing over the rich,

256
0:15:15,780 --> 0:15:17,940
not the rich screwing over the poor.

257
0:15:17,940 --> 0:15:20,099
Some people have condemned The Dark Knight Rises

258
0:15:20,099 --> 0:15:23,700
as anti-Occupy Wall Street propaganda for this very reason.

259
0:15:25,700 --> 0:15:28,419
It shows a society that seeks vengeance on the rich

260
0:15:28,419 --> 0:15:30,500
for no other reason than they're rich,

261
0:15:30,500 --> 0:15:33,059
and sets up kangaroo courts to punish them.

262
0:15:33,059 --> 0:15:34,260
No lawyer?

263
0:15:34,260 --> 0:15:35,059
No witnesses?

264
0:15:35,619 --> 0:15:37,780
What sort of due process is this?

265
0:15:37,780 --> 0:15:40,979
Without actually establishing what these people are rebelling against,

266
0:15:40,979 --> 0:15:43,940
it makes it look like the film is painting Occupy activists

267
0:15:43,940 --> 0:15:47,780
as nothing more than easily manipulated fascistic clowns.

268
0:15:47,780 --> 0:15:50,260
It's more of an issue of underdeveloped worldbuilding

269
0:15:50,260 --> 0:15:53,460
and not necessarily politically charged moralizing.

270
0:15:53,460 --> 0:15:57,219
As I said earlier, The Dark Knight Rises is far from a bad film.

271
0:15:57,219 --> 0:15:59,380
It unfortunately falls a bit short,

272
0:15:59,380 --> 0:16:01,859
but so goes the tragedy with many trilogies.

273
0:16:01,859 --> 0:16:05,700
With so many subplots, so many characters, so much ambition,

274
0:16:05,700 --> 0:16:07,380
and it being so long,

275
0:16:07,380 --> 0:16:10,099
it's hard not to see why some of this got a little messy.

276
0:16:10,099 --> 0:16:11,619
None of this even takes into account

277
0:16:11,619 --> 0:16:13,859
that this whole social unrest scenario

278
0:16:13,859 --> 0:16:17,859
is an elaborate fabrication from the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham.

279
0:16:17,859 --> 0:16:19,380
Which of course begs the question,

280
0:16:19,380 --> 0:16:22,260
why even bother with all this French Revolution stuff?

281
0:16:22,260 --> 0:16:24,820
But that's gonna have to be a subject for another video.

282
0:16:24,820 --> 0:16:28,179
With a little more finessing and a tad more attention on worldbuilding,

283
0:16:28,179 --> 0:16:31,140
this film could have been a Wisecrackian wet dream,

284
0:16:31,140 --> 0:16:34,659
and a fitting conclusion to one of the best trilogies of our time.

285
0:16:34,659 --> 0:16:37,219
It's almost that, but it's not.

286
0:16:37,219 --> 0:16:38,580
Thanks for watching Wisecrack.

287
0:16:38,580 --> 0:16:39,219
Peace.

288
0:16:39,299 --> 0:16:41,460
But just because this movie is a bit of a mess,

289
0:16:41,460 --> 0:16:43,859
doesn't mean your legal work has to be.

290
0:16:43,859 --> 0:16:44,979
See what I did there?

291
0:16:44,979 --> 0:16:47,940
LegalZoom is the smart way to take care of your legal needs,

292
0:16:47,940 --> 0:16:52,260
and they made the process of setting up a new business and more a total breeze.

293
0:16:52,260 --> 0:16:56,020
LegalZoom eliminates the guesswork of having to find an attorney you trust,

294
0:16:56,020 --> 0:16:58,099
wondering how much your legal work will cost,

295
0:16:58,099 --> 0:17:00,820
and having to take unnecessary trips to a lawyer's office,

296
0:17:00,820 --> 0:17:02,820
which always has terrible parking anyway.

297
0:17:02,820 --> 0:17:05,540
LegalZoom works with a network of independent attorneys

298
0:17:05,540 --> 0:17:07,780
to help you with all sorts of projects.

299
0:17:07,780 --> 0:17:09,300
The formation of your company,

300
0:17:09,300 --> 0:17:10,500
wills and trusts,

301
0:17:10,500 --> 0:17:11,939
trademarks and patents,

302
0:17:11,939 --> 0:17:12,660
contracts,

303
0:17:12,660 --> 0:17:13,300
and more.

304
0:17:13,300 --> 0:17:15,300
When we decided to do Wisecrack full-time,

305
0:17:15,300 --> 0:17:18,099
it was really important that we set up our business right.

306
0:17:18,099 --> 0:17:20,180
Separating our personal stuff from the company

307
0:17:20,180 --> 0:17:24,420
and navigating all the intricacies of state and local laws can be a huge pain.

308
0:17:24,420 --> 0:17:28,260
But LegalZoom offers the services and resources to make sure you get it done right.

309
0:17:28,260 --> 0:17:29,939
